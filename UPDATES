New version (0.7) available that is able to process PacBio data and tri-allelic variants. For PacBio data, quality values are sometimes not available
so the program assumes a constant sequencing error rate for all bases

some bug fixes and updates for long read data 

September 11 2013

New version of HapCUT (v.0.6) available for download. HapCUT can now generate haplotypes from fosmid pooled sequencing data 
((Kitzman et al., Nature Biotech 2011)) and also from ligation based mate-pair sequencing data.
The code was uploaded to github for the first time.

An updated version of HapCUT can be downloaded from attachments on main page (HAPCUT-v0.5.tar.gz). This includes pre-compiled binaries for linux and Mac OS.

Fixed overlapping Paired-end issue: if a paired-end read covers the same variant twice, it is only considered once in the fragment. Code evaluated
on 1000 Genomes low coverage data.

HapCUT now works with sorted BAM files and VCF files. It can also phase short insertion/deletion variants (indels).  HapCUT is now 10-100 times faster than earlier versions. 

July 05 2011 

HapCUT has been extended to handle next-generation sequence data. HapCUT requires the reads for a diploid genome (aligned to a reference genome) in SAM/BAM format and a set of heterozygous variants. HapCUT uses the samtools API to parse bam files.  


September 2007 

The first version of HapCUT was implemented and the paper submitted to ECCB 2008
